# Password Protected Files

Sometimes we may want to crack the hashes of files that are password protected such as PDF files, SSH private key passwords, Word/Excel files etc. In order to do this we would first have to:
1. Extract the hash from the password protected file
2. Use a cracking tool such as Hashcat to crack the hash
