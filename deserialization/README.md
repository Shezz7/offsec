# Introduction

**Serialization** is the process of turning some object into a data format that can be restored later. Objects are often serialized in order to save them to storage or to send as part of communications.

**Deserialization** is the reverse of serialization. It takes structured data from some format and rebuilds it into an object.

Some popular formats for serializing data include json and xml.
